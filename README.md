# 🎠 3D Infinite Carousel with Reactive Background Gradients

A smooth, infinite 3D carousel where each image dynamically drives a reactive, canvas-based background gradient that adapts to its colors.

## 🌟 Overview

This project creates a physics-driven **3D infinite carousel** with smooth drag and scroll interaction.  
Each image influences a **live animated background gradient** extracted directly from its dominant colors.

**Author:** [Asif Hridoy](https://github.com/asifhridoy)  
**Tech Stack:** Vanilla JS • Canvas API • CSS 3D Transforms • (Optional) GSAP

## 🚀 Features

- ♾️ **Infinite looped carousel**
- 🖱️ **Drag & wheel navigation**
- 🌈 **Reactive gradient background**
- 📱 **Responsive layout**
- ⚡ **GPU-friendly animations** with momentum & friction
- 🎬 **Smooth entry transitions** (if GSAP is included)

## 🧠 How It Works

- Cards are positioned in 3D space and animated with transforms.
- Each image’s dominant colors are extracted to update the background gradient.
- Motion physics simulate drag momentum and friction.
- Background gradients drift over time for a living, dynamic look.
